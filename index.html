        <p>I'm a third year student at RIT,
        currently studying Game Design, previously studying Software Engineering.
        Besides studying, I'm currently busy creating a card game, a monster
        collection game, and art for both the games and for practice. Outside of
        work, I regularly play whatever free to play games I can find as well
        the occasional session of which ever TTRPG system I'm playing, MTG, Vanguard,
        and YGO.</p>

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>I am working on a few things, as mentioned above. Along with all of that,
        I am worling on a feew programming projects during the summers, such as a
        <a rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/JLHGD/FantasyCharGen">DND random character generation app</a>, and a magical item generation app. In
        terms of art, I am currently working on figure drawing and, hopefully soon,
        inking / cleaning up line art. I am also slowly working on refining a simplistic
        TTRPG system, based on DND, but far simpler.</p>
